### Abstract
1. People rely too much on social media. We could build a personal tool that helps them focus on what really interests them in daily life.
### Method
#### Simple Design
1. At the same time, users want to keep up with friends’ lives—but not every day. They might prefer updates weekly, bi-weekly, monthly, etc.
2. Real-time short messages should serve only as quick personal logs. Later, users can curate those snippets into a polished diary or newsletter.
3. We should integrate with users’ calendars so they can easily add interesting activities as events and set reminders.
#### Publish
1. Platform:
	1. **Website**  
		- Start as a personal journal and grow into a full product.
	2. **Mobile App**  
		- Let users capture moments on the go and follow friends’ updates until it becomes a mature product.
