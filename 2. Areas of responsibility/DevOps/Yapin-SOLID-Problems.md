## How to validate my code adheres to the SOLID principles?
### Important
1. You can ask yourself the following questions to evaluate your code against the SOLID principles:

-   `Does each class have a single responsibility?`
-   `Are classes open for extension but closed for modification?`
-   `Are subtypes substitutable for their base types?`
-   `Do classes have small, focused interfaces?`
-   `Do high-level modules depend on abstractions instead of low-level modules?`

	By answering these questions honestly and applying the SOLID principles, you can improve the quality of your code and make it more maintainable and extensible.
	
### Extension
1. SOLID is a set of principles that can guide you in writing good object-oriented code that is easy to maintain, extend and understand. Here's a brief overview of each principle:

	-   Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change, i.e., it should have only one responsibility.
	-   Open/Closed Principle (OCP): A class should be open for extension but closed for modification.
	-   Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types, i.e., a subclass should be able to replace its parent class without affecting the correctness of the program.
	-   Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): A client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use, i.e., classes should have small, focused interfaces.
	-   Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.

	To ensure that your code follows these principles, you can use a combination of techniques such as code reviews, unit testing, refactoring, and design patterns. You can also use static analysis tools or code analyzers that check your code for violations of the SOLID principles.
