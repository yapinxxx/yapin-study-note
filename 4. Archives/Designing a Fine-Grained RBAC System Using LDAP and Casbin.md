# RBAC System Design Using LDAP and Casbin
[[Access Control]]

  

## Introduction

This document outlines the design of a role-based access control (RBAC) system that uses LDAP for user authentication and Casbin for access control enforcement. The system is designed to provide fine-grained access control for a web application.

  

## Architecture Overview

The RBAC system consists of the following components:

  

1. LDAP Server

2. Web Application

3. Casbin Library

  

### LDAP Server

The LDAP server is used to store user authentication information, such as usernames and passwords. It is used to authenticate users who attempt to access the web application. The LDAP server should be configured to allow read access by the web application.

  

### Web Application

The web application is the application that needs to enforce access control policies. It interacts with the Casbin library to enforce access control rules and with the LDAP server to authenticate users.

  

The web application should have the following features:

  

1. User authentication

2. Access control enforcement

  

#### User authentication

The web application should have a login page that allows users to enter their username and password. The web application should then use the LDAP server to authenticate the user. If the user is successfully authenticated, the web application should store the user's role in the user's session.

  

#### Access control enforcement

The web application should use the Casbin library to enforce access control rules. The web application should retrieve the user's role from the user's session and use the role to determine if the user is allowed to access a protected resource. If the user is not allowed to access the resource, the web application should return an error message.

  

### Casbin Library

The Casbin library is used to enforce access control rules in the web application. It uses a policy file to define access control rules, which are then enforced by the Casbin library. The policy file should be stored in a location that is accessible to the web application.

  

The policy file should define the following information:

  

1. Roles

2. Permissions

3. Access control rules

  

## Conclusion

This document outlines the design of an RBAC system that uses LDAP for user authentication and Casbin for access control enforcement. The system is designed to provide fine-grained access control for a web application and should be easy to maintain and extend.
