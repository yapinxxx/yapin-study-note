# Timeshift
1. Once Timeshift is opened, select the Snapshot type from the next window. You have two options to choose from:
	- ****RSync****: Snapshots are taken using [rsync](https://linuxhandbook.com/rsync-command-examples/) and [hard-links](https://linuxhandbook.com/hard-link/). Common files are shared between snapshots, which saves disk space. Each snapshot is a full system backup that can be browsed with a file manager.
	- ****BTRFS****: Snapshots are taken using the in-built features of the BTRFS file system. BTRFS snapshots are ****supported only on BTRFS systems**** having an Ubuntu-type subvolume layout (with @ and @home subvolumes).
