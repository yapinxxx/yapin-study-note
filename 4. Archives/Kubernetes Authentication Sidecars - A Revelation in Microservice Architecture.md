# Kubernetes Authentication Sidecars - A Revelation in Microservice Architecture

## History

### Cookie authentication

Cookies have been used to authenticate front-end applications for a while, but traditionally they have had some downsides:
- CSRF attacks
- Session cookies

### JWT authentication

Along came JSON Web Tokens, which helped us solve some of these drawbacks with cookies by providing self-validating stateless tokens. JWTs can be decoded to retrieve a user‚Äôs claims and validated on any server using a public key.

For these reasons, over recent years, JWTs have been pushed by promoters as the holy grail of authentication‚Ä¶ Unfortunately, our tale does not end there! There are some key disadvantages to using JWTs that people often overlook or do not understand (There‚Äôs a great article explaining [here](https://redis.com/blog/json-web-tokens-jwt-are-dangerous-for-user-sessions/) if you‚Äôd like to know more):
- Revocation
- XSS Attacks

### Web Security to the Rescue!
Luckily over time, a lot of the issues with cookies and JWTs have been prevented with security features:
- 'SameSite' cookie policy
- 'HttpOnly' cookie
- Data Protection Keys
- CORS and CSPs


### JWTs are Dead; Long Live the Cookie!

### Self Authentication Approach

### Sidecar Authentication Approach
