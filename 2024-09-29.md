This week, I still can't type Taiwanese on Ubuntu 24.04. The main problem is a Qt package dependency error. Another issue is that although i-thoan forked the source code from the RIME project, they added too much of their own style, making the code appear quite different. However, they still use the same method to deploy the input method via YAML files.

I think if I follow RIME’s development progress, I might be able to solve this problem, and that approach seems easier for someone like me, who is new to input method development.

While tracing the commit history of the i-thoan source code, I also found something interesting: i-thoan removed all OpenCC code because one of their members discovered the keyword "hoeh-se tai-oan" in OpenCC files. I also disagree with using this phrase in the dictionary. If "hoeh-se" is a phrase, that’s fine, but why must "tai-oan" be added after it in such a negative or even racist context? It seems unreasonable.

Do you think adding phrases like "chi-na," "tiong-kok," "hiong-kang," "su-chhoan," and "o-loo-su" is reasonable? Based on this, I strongly agree with i-thoan’s decision to remove OpenCC from their code.

But it's so difficult for me! I’ve tried everything I can think of to get i-thoan working on my Ubuntu 24.04, but nothing has worked. I’ve decided to give up on this approach. I’ll start from scratch by following the RIME development guide, and once I get that working, I’ll try to incorporate i-thoan’s solution.

On top of that, I have another issue. I need to spend some time preparing for something critical related to my career, but I’m really upset that I still can’t type Taiwanese on Ubuntu. I'm feeling quite anxious.

However, as an adult, I think I should make a rational choice. Otherwise, I’ll remain anxious and accomplish nothing.
