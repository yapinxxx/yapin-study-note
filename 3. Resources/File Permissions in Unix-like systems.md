Sure! In Unix-like systems, file permissions are represented by a three-digit octal number, where each digit represents a different set of permissions. The leftmost digit represents the file type, and the remaining digits represent the file permissions for the owner, group, and others. Here's how the permissions are encoded in the octal number:

-   **File type**:
    
    -   `0`: Regular file
    -   `1`: Directory
    -   `2`: Symbolic link
    -   `3`: Character device file
    -   `4`: Block device file
    -   `5`: Named pipe (FIFO)
    -   `6`: Socket
    -   `7`: Unknown
-   **Permissions for the owner**:
    
    -   `0`: No permissions
    -   `1`: Execute permission
    -   `2`: Write permission
    -   `3`: Write and execute permissions
    -   `4`: Read permission
    -   `5`: Read and execute permissions
    -   `6`: Read and write permissions
    -   `7`: Read, write, and execute permissions
-   **Permissions for the group**:
    
    -   `0`: No permissions
    -   `1`: Execute permission
    -   `2`: Write permission
    -   `3`: Write and execute permissions
    -   `4`: Read permission
    -   `5`: Read and execute permissions
    -   `6`: Read and write permissions
    -   `7`: Read, write, and execute permissions
-   **Permissions for others**:
    
    -   `0`: No permissions
    -   `1`: Execute permission
    -   `2`: Write permission
    -   `3`: Write and execute permissions
    -   `4`: Read permission
    -   `5`: Read and execute permissions
    -   `6`: Read and write permissions
    -   `7`: Read, write, and execute permissions

For example, the octal number `0644` represents a regular file with read and write permissions for the owner and read-only permissions for the group and others. The octal number `0755` represents a directory with read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, and read and execute permissions for the group and others.
